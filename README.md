CG project using OPEN-GL.

# Description of the Project
<pre> 
In this project weâ€™ve shown a scene from an urban landscape and simulate it using C++ and Open GL libraries. The simulation consists of two times of a day â€“ Day (accessed by the â€˜Dâ€™ key on the keyboard) and Night (accessed by the â€˜Nâ€™ key on the keyboard). It also consists of a moving tram on a road, a moving ferry in the lake, a keyboard controllable traffic light, trees, some urban buildings (Hospital etc.), clouds in motion (Day), the Sun (Day), the Moon (Night) and stars (Night). On a right click menu, we can also have Aeroplane going by and a Comet (Night only). The flow of the landscape on various inputs is given below â€“ 

[Keyboard] Type â€˜Dâ€™ or â€˜dâ€™:
â€¢	The landscape will be in Day Mode.
[Keyboard] Type â€˜Nâ€™ or â€˜nâ€™:
â€¢	The landscape will be in Night Mode.
[Keyboard] Type â€˜Râ€™ or â€˜râ€™:
â€¢	The â€˜redâ€™ traffic light will turn on (Red).
â€¢	The â€˜greenâ€™ traffic light will turn off (Black).
â€¢	The tram will stop at its current position.
[Keyboard] Type â€˜Gâ€™ or â€˜gâ€™:
â€¢	The â€˜greenâ€™ traffic light will turn on (Green).
â€¢	The â€˜redâ€™ traffic light will turn off (Black).
â€¢	The tram will continue its motion.
[Mouse] Right Click:
â€¢	Select â€˜Aeroplaneâ€™:
o	An Aeroplane will fly from right to left in the sky irrespective of the time of the day.
â€¢	Select â€˜Cometâ€™:
o	A comet will fly from left to right in the sky in the Night Mode only.
â€¢	Select â€˜Quitâ€™:
o	Closes the simulation.

The scenery is designed according to the time of the day (Modes) which are described as follows â€“ 

Day Mode â€“ 
o	The sky will change its color to sky blue.
o	The Moon will disappear and is replaced by the Sun.
o	The stars will disappear, and the sky will show moving clouds.
o	The Comet visibility will be off.
o	The Hospital lights will turn off (change to blue, colour of the sky reflected from the glass)
o	The Lake water will be of a lighter blue shade.
Night Mode â€“ 
o	The sky will change its colour to grey.
o	The Sun will disappear and is replaced by the Moon.
o	The clouds will disappear, and the sky will show stars.
o	The Comet visibility will be on.
o	The Hospital lights will turn on (change to yellow)
o	The Lake water will be of a darker blue shade.
