# Computer_Graphics_Project
CG project using OPEN-GL.

# Description of the Project
In this project we’ve shown a scene from an urban landscape and simulate it using C++ and Open GL libraries. The simulation consists of two times of a day – Day (accessed by the ‘D’ key on the keyboard) and Night (accessed by the ‘N’ key on the keyboard). It also consists of a moving tram on a road, a moving ferry in the lake, a keyboard controllable traffic light, trees, some urban buildings (Hospital etc.), clouds in motion (Day), the Sun (Day), the Moon (Night) and stars (Night). On a right click menu, we can also have Aeroplane going by and a Comet (Night only). The flow of the landscape on various inputs is given below – 

[Keyboard] Type ‘D’ or ‘d’:
•	The landscape will be in Day Mode.
[Keyboard] Type ‘N’ or ‘n’:
•	The landscape will be in Night Mode.
[Keyboard] Type ‘R’ or ‘r’:
•	The ‘red’ traffic light will turn on (Red).
•	The ‘green’ traffic light will turn off (Black).
•	The tram will stop at its current position.
[Keyboard] Type ‘G’ or ‘g’:
•	The ‘green’ traffic light will turn on (Green).
•	The ‘red’ traffic light will turn off (Black).
•	The tram will continue its motion.
[Mouse] Right Click:
•	Select ‘Aeroplane’:
o	An Aeroplane will fly from right to left in the sky irrespective of the time of the day.
•	Select ‘Comet’:
o	A comet will fly from left to right in the sky in the Night Mode only.
•	Select ‘Quit’:
o	Closes the simulation.

The scenery is designed according to the time of the day (Modes) which are described as follows – 

Day Mode – 
o	The sky will change its color to sky blue.
o	The Moon will disappear and is replaced by the Sun.
o	The stars will disappear, and the sky will show moving clouds.
o	The Comet visibility will be off.
o	The Hospital lights will turn off (change to blue, colour of the sky reflected from the glass)
o	The Lake water will be of a lighter blue shade.
Night Mode – 
o	The sky will change its colour to grey.
o	The Sun will disappear and is replaced by the Moon.
o	The clouds will disappear, and the sky will show stars.
o	The Comet visibility will be on.
o	The Hospital lights will turn on (change to yellow)
o	The Lake water will be of a darker blue shade.
